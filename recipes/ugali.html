    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups of Maize flour(coarse cornmeal)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat water over medium heat in a deep pan. Make sure you take a pan with a handle.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle about 1 tbsp of the maize meal while the water comes to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the maize meal or cornmeal and keep on stirring with a strong wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring and pressing the mixture against the sides of the pan to break up the lumps.</li>
        <li>As the mixture becomes thicker, it becomes more difficult to mix but keep mixing and breaking up the lumps</li>
        <li>Allow it to cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>At this point either transfer the ugali to a platter from the pan. Place the plate over the pan and turn it upside down.</li>
        <li>Or you can transfer to a small heatproof bowl. Pat it down into shape. Place a plate over the bowl and turn it over.</li>
        <li>Enjoy piping hot ugali with your favourite stew or curry</li>
